Goal: Develop a Java application that converts binary numbers (input as a string) into decimal numbers.


Structure:
     -User Interface: Design a console-based or GUI interface using Java frameworks (e.g., Swing, JavaFX, or simple CLI for basic functionality).
     -Expense Management: Implement features for adding, editing, and deleting expenses, and categorizing them.
     -Reports: Generate expense reports, showing detailed breakdowns and summaries of expenses over time.


Technologies:
     -Java: For developing the application’s core logic and features.
     -JDBC/SQLite: For database interaction (to store and retrieve expense data).
     -Swing/JavaFX (Optional): For building a GUI for better user interaction (if not a console application).

Optional:
     -JDBC/SQLite/JavaDB: For persistent data storage of expenses in a local database.
     -Apache POI: For generating expense reports in Excel format.
     -JSON/XML: For exporting or importing expense data (optional).

Deliverables:
     -Complete Java project files (including source code and necessary configuration files).
     -JAR file for running the application.
     -Documentation of the application’s functionality, usage, and setup.

Checklist:
     -Design the system for expense tracking with relevant fields (amount, category, date, etc.).
     -Implement functionality to add, edit, view, and delete expenses.
     -Implement a report generation system that displays detailed reports of expenses.
     -Integrate database storage (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to persist the expense data.
     -Test the application in different environments (e.g., different Java versions, OS).
     -Submit the complete project files and documentation.
